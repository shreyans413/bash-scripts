# üñ•Ô∏è Bash Scripts for Syntax Reference  

This repository contains various **Bash scripts** that I wrote while learning Bash from a YouTube tutorial. The scripts cover essential Bash concepts, including loops, conditionals, functions, and more. I plan to use these as a **syntax reference** for future projects.
